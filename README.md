## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

With the development of this project, I have improved my skills with React. It was a novelty for me to work with the dnd kit library, which makes drag and drop with React much easier while maintaining harmony between all site components. I also put into practice a slightly more complex React hook, such as useReducer, but everything flowed smoothly. I am satisfied with the outcome and look forward to continuing to evolve.

### Continued development

I intend to continue developing my skills in JavaScript and React through the creation of more complex projects, making my knowledge increasingly useful, and ultimately securing my first job as a programmer.The next step will be to learn a state management tool such as Redux Toolkit.
